# MSDDAEF
This is the PyTorch implementation of the Multi-Source Deep Domain Adaptation Ensemble Framework for Cross-Dataset Motor Imagery EEG Transfer Learning

This is an example of when GIST is the source domain and openBMI is the target domain. The code is similar when the target domain is exchanged with the source domain.

The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility  of cross-dataset knowledge transfer. This can largely relax the constraint of training samples for MI BCIs and thus has important practical sense.
