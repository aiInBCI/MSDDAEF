This is the PyTorch implementation of the Multi-Source Deep Domain Adaptation Ensemble Framework for Cross-Dataset Motor Imagery EEG Transfer Learning

The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility  of cross-dataset knowledge transfer. This can largely relax the constraint of training samples for MI BCIs and thus has important practical sense.
